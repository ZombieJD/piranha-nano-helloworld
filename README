  ======

  This project has been setup to build and run your Servlet locally
  on port 8080 using the DefaultHttpServer. Feel free to customize
  it to your needs.

  When you build it you can find the JLink image in the target/jlink
  directory. Note that the resulting image is OS dependent.

  If you have any questions and/or suggestions feel free to leave
  them as issues at the GitHub issue tracker at:
